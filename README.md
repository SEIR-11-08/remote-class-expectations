## How To Ask For Help
<strong>Questions about a lesson</strong>:

- General lesson questions post to the slack channel: `sei-sf09-parking-lot`.
- During lectures, please feel free to unmute and <em>"interrupt"</em>. Instructors can't see "raised hands" during remote instruction.

<strong>Questions about code</strong>: please make a <em>descriptive</em> post about your issue in the debugging channel - include in it the relevant code snippet (use the Slack code snippet feature), some context around it, and the specific error you are receiving.

<strong>Requesting 1:1 instructor assistance</strong>: Instructors will be available for 1:1 time via Zoom, and will be happy to assist you. Remember the <strong>20 minute rule</strong>: Never spend more than 20 minutes on a problem before asking for help. When you request instructor support, please be prepared to explain your thought process about the problem, and all of the steps that you took to try to solve it. Consider the following questions:

* What is your understanding of the error you're receiving? What clue does the error give you as to how to solve it?
* Did you look up the error in order to get a better understanding of what it means?
* What have you tried to do in order to remedy the problem?
* What lesson or outside sources have you referenced?

If you cannot answer these questions, the instructors may ask you to go find these answers before assisting you further.

## FAQ
<details>
<summary><b>How will projects be handled in a remote format?</b></summary>
Project collaboration will be done over Zoom. We will be creating breakout rooms for each project group, and you will be required to be in them (with webcam on) during class time. Feel free to keep your mic muted and listen to music etc while working, but you should be still have your webcam on and should be available if a project member needs to ask you a question.

The added benefit to this format is that instructors will be able to more easily assist your entire group all at once!
